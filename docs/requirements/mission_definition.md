# ðŸš€ Mission Definition

This project defines a CubeSat telecommunication mission aimed at relaying IoT data or amateur radio signals. The CubeSat will operate in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at approximately 500 km in a sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), enabling consistent ground station visibility and efficient solar power generation.

The CubeSat's primary mission is to demonstrate the feasibility of using small satellites to relay low-bandwidth data from ground sensors to central nodes. It is designed using Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) principles in Capella to ensure rigorous definition, traceability, and integration.
